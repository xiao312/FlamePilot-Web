FlamePilot Web UI is a modern, responsive interface for FlamePilot CLI, Google's Gemini-powered AI assistant for coding. Adapted from [Gemini-CLI-Web](https://github.com/ssdeanx/Gemini-CLI-Web) and [Gemini-CLI-UI](https://github.com/cruzyjapan/Gemini-CLI-UI), it provides desktop and mobile access to FlamePilot CLI functionality with enhanced features and improved user experience. You can use it locally or remotely to view your active projects and sessions in FlamePilot CLI and make changes the same way you would in the CLI.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20.19.3 (recommended for development)
- [FlamePilot CLI](https://github.com/flamepilot/cli) installed and configured

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flamepilot/web-ui.git
cd flamepilot-web-ui
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure environment:**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your preferred settings
```

**Note**: The `.env` file has been removed for security. Always copy `.env.example` to `.env` when using and modify settings as needed.

4. **Start the application:**

```bash
# Development mode (with hot reload)
npm run dev
```

The application will start at the port you specified in your .env

5. **Open your browser:**
   - Development: `http://localhost:4009`

## Development Environment

This project is developed using Node.js v20.19.3. For consistent development experience:

```bash
# Using nvm (recommended)
nvm use 20.19.3

# Verify version
node --version  # v20.19.3
npm --version   # Compatible npm version
```

## Security & Tools Configuration

**🔒 Important Notice**: All FlamePilot CLI tools are **disabled by default**. This prevents potentially harmful operations from running automatically.

### Enabling Tools

To use FlamePilot CLI's full functionality, you'll need to manually enable tools:

1. **Open Tools Settings** - Click the gear icon in the sidebar
2. **Enable Selectively** - Turn on only the tools you need
3. **Apply Settings** - Your preferences are saved locally

### About YOLO Mode

YOLO mode ("You Only Live Once") is equivalent to FlamePilot CLI's `--yolo` flag, skipping all confirmation prompts. This mode speeds up your work but should be used with caution.

**Recommended approach**: Start with basic tools enabled and add more as needed. You can always adjust these settings later.

- These ports can be changed in the `.env` file

### Database Configuration

#### Initial Setup and Table Structure

- **Database File**: `server/database/geminicliui_auth.db`
- **Database Type**: SQLite 3
- **Initialization**: Automatically created and initialized on server startup

#### User Table Details

**Table Name**: `geminicliui_users`

| Column | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `id` | INTEGER | PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT | Unique user identifier |
| `username` | TEXT | UNIQUE NOT NULL | Login username (email recommended) |
| `password_hash` | TEXT | NOT NULL | bcrypt hashed password |
| `created_at` | DATETIME | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | Account creation timestamp |
| `last_login` | DATETIME | NULL | Last login timestamp |
| `is_active` | BOOLEAN | DEFAULT 1 | Account active/inactive status |

**Indexes**:

- `idx_geminicliui_users_username`: For fast username lookups
- `idx_geminicliui_users_active`: For filtering active users

#### First Run Setup

1. On first server startup, database file is automatically created if it doesn't exist
2. Table structure is loaded from `server/database/init.sql`
3. First access displays user registration screen
4. First user is registered as administrator

#### Security Features

- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt before storage
- JWT token-based authentication system
- Session management with timeout functionality
- SQL injection protection (prepared statements used)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### "No FlamePilot projects found"

**Problem**: The UI shows no projects or empty project list
**Solutions**:

- Ensure FlamePilot CLI is properly installed
- Run `flamepilot` command in at least one project directory to initialize
- Verify `~/.flamepilot/projects/` directory exists and has proper permissions

#### File Explorer Issues

**Problem**: Files not loading, permission errors, empty directories
**Solutions**:

- Check project directory permissions (`ls -la` in terminal)
- Verify the project path exists and is accessible
- Review server console logs for detailed error messages
- Ensure you're not trying to access system directories outside project scope

#### Model Selection Not Working

**Problem**: Selected model is not being used
**Solutions**:

- After selecting a model in settings, make sure to click "Save Settings"
- Clear browser local storage and reconfigure
- Verify the model name is displayed correctly in the chat interface
